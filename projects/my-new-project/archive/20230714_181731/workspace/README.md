Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the snake game implementation:

1. Model:
- Snake: Represents the snake in the game. Responsible for maintaining the snake's position, length, and movement.
- Food: Represents the food in the game. Responsible for generating new food at random positions.
- Game: Represents the game state. Responsible for managing the game loop, updating the snake and food positions, and detecting collisions.

2. View:
- Renderer: Responsible for rendering the game state on the screen.

3. Controller:
- InputHandler: Responsible for handling user input, specifically keyboard controls.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.

1. main.py

This file serves as the entry point of the application. It initializes the game and starts the game loop.
